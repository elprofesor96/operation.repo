# Operation Repo TODO

change the documentation to also say that this tool is also good for making dev products like we build a python app so we make a template to have files like README.md, LICENSE.md, TODO.md, src folder, pyproject.toml, .github/workflows


## Dev

- need to find a way to autmate CD to build .deb 
- need to learn how to create brew formulae for macos users (*)


## Security

- SERVER SECURITY (restrictive shell, do not let user to login, only available commands: ls -al)
